You will have three different targets today. The first one is an easy target to get used to the tools. You will need to connect to our local network in order to do this. Then you can choose between two IPs to hack (both will be the same setup so it doesn't really matter).
```
192.168.1.202
```
```
192.168.1.116
```

When you feel confident, you can start on a more challenging target. You can pick between two different ones:

[OWASP WebGoat](http://68.183.67.32:8080/WebGoat)<br>
[OWASP Jucie Shop](http://188.166.166.95:3000/)

I have already done some vulnerability scanning with [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) that you can find them here:
